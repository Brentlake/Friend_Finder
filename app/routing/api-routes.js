//var friendsData = require('../app/data/friends.js');

//module.exports = function(app){

	//app.get('/api/friends', function(req, res){
		//res.json(friendsData);
	//});
//}

//again having same issues getting correct path. Also if you un comment the module.exports is showing exports as a method and turning green when i put
//function after it. When I set it = to something though like tableArray the exports shows up blue.
